 1. First rinse and shred or chop all the veggies, then set aside. You will need 1 cup shredded cabbage, ½ shredded carrots, ⅓ sliced capsicum.
Next heat 5 to 6 cups of water in a pan.

2. Then when the water comes to a boil, add ½ teaspoon salt.
Next add ½ teaspoon oil and mix well. Add any neutral oil.

3.  Then add the noodles (about 200 grams). I have used whole wheat noodles.

4. Now boil until the noodles are cooked.

5.  Then drain the cooked noodles in a sieve.

6. Next rinse the noodles with fresh water.

7. After that, set aside. You can even toss the noodles recipe with 2 to 3 teaspoons oil if desired.

8. Now heat 2 to 3 tablespoons of toasted sesame oil in a pan. Keep the heat to low or medium-low. 

9. Then add the veggies: ½ cup shredded carrots, ⅓ cup thinly sliced capsicum and 1 cup shredded cabbage.

10. Now continue to toss and stir fry on a medium to high heat until the veggies are almost cooked. If possible it is best to use a pan with handles as it is better to lift it while tossing. 

You can also decrease the flame if the heat becomes too much to handle and then stir fry the veggies on a medium heat.

11. Some crunch should be there in the vegetables, so don’t cook the vegetables until they become completely soft.

12. Next add 1 to 2 tablespoons of soya sauce. Mix well.

13. Then add salt and crushed pepper as required.

14. Stir and mix very well.

15. Now add the cooked noodles.

16. Keep on tossing and stirring till the veggies are mixed well for minute or two. Switch off the heat. Check the taste and add more salt, black pepper or soy sauce if required to the veggie noodles.

17. Then add 1 teaspoon rice vinegar or regular white vinegar.

18. Finally, serve this veg noodles recipe steaming hot as it is or with some chilli sauce or tomato sauce.
